Graphics for game: 
Scalable vector graphics, all have to be .swf format. 
Game is based on a grid, so they should be squares.

	Character:
		Standing: facing up, down and side
		Walking/sliding/moving: up, down and side
		

	Blocks:
		Ice (or other kind of thing that breaks after being stepped on)
		Rock (or other thing that doesnt break after being stepped on)
		Ending goal block

	Background:
		Backgrounds should either be tileable, or in 16:9 aspect ratio. This makes it so it can fit the game screen without stretching
		
	
	Other stuff:
		Title banner: this is the thing that says the name of the game on the title screen. The title of the game isnt decided yet, so if you think of something good use that.
